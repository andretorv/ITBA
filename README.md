# ITBA-RedesNeurales-TP1
Repository for TP1, Andr√© Torvestad, september 2022

The included notebooks are for solving TP1 in Redes Neurales en Bioingeneria at ITBA, september 2022. There are two problems to be solved: one classification problem and one regression problem. The solutions and explanation can be found in their respective notebooks. 

Both solutions use the sequential model from Keras to evaluate data and make predictions (for both regression and classification) based on the data. The notebooks are divided into oen part for data analysis and one part for tuning of neural networks.
